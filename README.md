### Introduction
Multi Disease prediction using machine learning is an emerging field in healthcare that uses data analutics and statstical models to predict the likelihood of a m ulti disease in patients.The goal of this approach is toprovide accurate and timely diagnose ,as well as personalized treatment plans based on the patients specific risk factors.Machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets of patient information .Multi disease prediction has the potential to improve the healthcare outcomes by allowing to detecet disease early, which can lead to more effective tratments and improved patients poutcomes.
